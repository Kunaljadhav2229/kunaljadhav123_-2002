            Bharatratn Maharshi Dhondo Keshav Karve, Bharatratn Pandurang Vaman
            Kane, Swatantryaveer Savarkar and Bharatratn Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar.
            Ratnagiri district has become welknown, due to freedom fighter
            Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, who had been captured in Ratnagiri by the
            British government. Ratnagiri is a coastal district of Maharashtra
            state, situated in the western coast of India. This district
            contains numerous beaches, creeks, sea forts, harbours, hot water
            springs, caves, temples and other religious places, places of scenic
            beauty as well as birthplace of some great personalities.
            Geographical Information Ratnagiri is a coastal district of
            Maharashtra state, situated in the western coast of India. It has
            north-south length of about 180 km and average east-west extension
            of about 64 km. This district comes between 16.30 to 18.04 north
            latitudes and 73.02 to 73.53 east longitude. Ratnagiri can be
            physically divided into 3 zones. Coastal Zone – This zone extends to
            about 10-15 km from seacoast and generally has low altitude and
            about 2500 mm rainfall. Most of the activities in this area are
            connected with sea. This area contains numerous beaches,creeks, sea
            forts, harbors, hot water springs, caves, temples and other
            religious places, places of scenic beauty as well as birthplace of
            some great personalities. The possible tourist activities include
            inland and sea water ways, sailing, boating, water sports like water
            scooter, canoeing, fishing, camping, marinas, coastal resorts and
            marine parks; but the major problem is the lack of easy
            accessibility and road network. Hill area Zone – This area includes
            the western slopes of Sahyadri and extends up to about 10-15 km. It
            generally has medium to high altitude with high rainfall of about
            3500 mm. A large area in this zone is covered by forest although it
            is deteriorating very fast. A substantial drop in temperature is
            experienced at places exposed to the rising western breeze. This
            area contains hill forts, ghat roads, forests, wild life, etc. It
            gives panoramic views at many places.The possible tourist activities
            include trekking, hiking, forest camps, holiday resorts, bird
            sanctuaries, wild life safari, etc Middle Zone – This area lies
            between the coastal and hill areas and generally has a medium
            altitude. It is more accessible due to the Bombay-Goa-Highway as
            well as the Konkan railway. However, it contains very few places of
            tourist interest, mostly religious places and hot water springs.
            Rivers Ratnagiri district has major rivers like Washishi, Jagbudi,
            Savitri, Baw, Ratnagiri, Mukchundi, Jaitapur etc. They swell in the
            Sahyadri Mountains and flows to the west and get access to Arabian
            sea. Since the river basins are shallow, their flow is very speed in
            the monsoon season. Therefore, these rivers have limited use.
            Mountain Range There are upper rows of Sahyadri on the eastern
            boundary of the district. The height of these mountain peaks is
            generally 400 to 2000 meters. There are numerous mountain ranges in
            parallel to each other, entering the Ratnagiri district. Forest area
            The total forest area of Ratnagiri district is 7001.67 hector. In
            this forest, trees like teak, Nilgiri, Khair, Cashew, Mango, Cashew,
            Fanas, Mother, Dhaman, Shivan, Sugar, Khayar, Jambhul, Chinch and
            Shivari are found. The district has area of 8208 sq.km out of which
            the reserve forest area is 48.91%. , the protected forest area is
